# Arduino Weather Logger

![Weather Logger Mounted](./readme-media/weather-logger-mounted.webp)

An IoT weather monitoring system that collects temperature, humidity, and light level data and sends it to ThingSpeak for visualization and analysis.

## Features

- üå°Ô∏è Temperature monitoring using DHT22 sensor
- üíß Humidity measurement
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Light level detection
- üì∂ WiFi signal strength monitoring
- üìä Data visualization on ThingSpeak
- üîã Power-efficient design with deep sleep mode
- üñ•Ô∏è Local OLED display for current readings

## Hardware Requirements

- NodeMCU V2.0 (ESP8266)
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Photocell (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10kŒ© Resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for programming

## Hardware Setup

### Pin Connections

| NodeMCU Pin | Connection               |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| D0          | Connected to RST (for deep sleep) |
| D1          | DHT22 Data Pin           |
| A0          | Light Sensor Circuit     |
| 3.3V        | Power for sensors        |
| GND         | Ground                   |

### Light Sensor Circuit
1. Connect one leg of the photocell to 3.3V
2. Connect the other leg to A0 and one end of 10kŒ© resistor
3. Connect the other end of the resistor to GND

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support
- Required Arduino Libraries:
  - `ESP8266WiFi`
  - `ThingSpeak`
  - `DHT sensor library`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** to your Arduino projects folder
2. **Rename `credentials.example.h` to `credentials.h`**
3. **Edit `credentials.h`** with your WiFi and ThingSpeak credentials:
   ```cpp
   #define SECRET_SSID "your_wifi_ssid"
   #define SECRET_PASS "your_wifi_password"
   #define SECRET_CH_ID 1109913         // Replace with your ThingSpeak Channel ID
   #define SECRET_WRITE_APIKEY "YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY"  // Replace with your ThingSpeak Write API Key
   ```

4. **Upload the sketch** to your NodeMCU
5. **Monitor the Serial Console** (9600 baud) to verify operation

## ThingSpeak Integration

This project sends data to a ThingSpeak channel with the following field mapping:

| Field | Measurement |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Temperature (¬∞F) |
| 2     | Light Level (%) |
| 3     | Humidity (%) |
| 4     | WiFi Signal Strength (dBm) |

## Power Management

The device is designed for low power consumption:
- Deep sleep mode between readings (default: 30 minutes)
- Wakes up to take measurements and transmit data
- LED indicator shows when the device is active

## Field Testing

## Assembly

I replaced the modular solar input and USB power jacks with custom wiring

![Circuit Layout](./readme-media/weather-logger-layout-before-boxing.webp)

I used TinkerCAD to design a box to house the NodeMCU breadboard and power
components I had in a weatherproof enclosure that could be mounted behind
the solar panel for weather protection and consolidation.  It's translucent
so the power LED can be seen.

## Customization

You can adjust the following in the code:
- Sleep duration: Modify `sleepSeconds` in `weather-logger.ino`
- Sensor pins: Update pin definitions in the respective header files
- Measurement units: Adjust temperature conversion in `dht22.cpp` if needed

## Troubleshooting

- **Device not connecting to WiFi**: Check your credentials and network settings
- **Incorrect sensor readings**: Verify wiring and sensor connections
- **Deep sleep not working**: Ensure D0 is connected to RST
- **Upload issues**: Disconnect D0 from RST before uploading new code
